# Vanchor

For controlling speed and direction of an electrical trolling motor.
The goal here is to be able to use (almost) any cheap trolling motor while still having autopilot/follow route features.

The current version gets it's coordinates from my Humminbird plotter. But it's easy to add support for cheap GPS modules that you hook up to the Raspberry.

**Keep in mind that many aspects of this build can cause fires, chopped of fingers and/or other dangers.**

Also, I learned the hard way that it is a good idea to get a wrist-strap or something similar for your phone :)

## Current features (Everything is not tested yet):

- Web interface
  - Control of trolling motor
  - Configuration
- NMEA 0184 (TX/RX)
- NMEA through TCP (TX/RX)
  - Connect Navionics app, iNavX etc
- Virtual Anchor (Vanchor) based on position (NMEA RMC)
- Autopilot (NMEA APB sentence)
- Autopilot (GPX files)
- Lock heading (NMEA RMC sentence and/or e-compass)
- PID steering

## Planned

- Extensive testing before it get's to cold outside.
- Adding support for GPS module instead of getting position from plotter.

## Wishlist

- Some kind of simulation software
- Rough PID settings for boats/motors of different sizes
- Relying on a regular DC motor instead of a stepper for steering. And using a potentiometer for position-feedback.

## Details

### Web interface

Served from a flask server.
It's based on bootstrap4 and js (+jquery) and has a compass that visually shows the direction that you are heading, depth and so on.

The webinterface allows you to edit the config file and to update vanchor by uploading a ZIP so that you don't have to take your laptop with you to do changes.

### [Function] Vanchor

**V**irtual **Anchor** holds the boat in the current coordinates.
It uses a PID regulator to controll trolling motor speed in case of current or wind.

### [Function] Lock Heading

Lock heading can lock heading with and without GPS.

If GPS is available it will take current heading and set a destination point 1000km further away.
After that it starts to generate NMEA APB sentences with Cross-Track-Error that it follows.

This will counteract drifting to the sides due to wind or current.

If GPS is not available it will just take your current heading and try to keep that.

### [Function] Autopilot

Autopilot has 2 modes:

1. APB from NMEA (ie. plotter)
2. APB from GPX files

APB from GPX takes the coordinates of a GPX-file (with \<WP\> tags) and generates an NMEA APB-sentence with cross-track-error(XTE) / direction that it follows.

XTE magnitude is added to the feedback of the PID-controller.

## Configuring the raspberry (Without existing wifi/network on the boat)

1. Clone vanchor to /opt/vanchor
2. Run `/opt/vanchor/scripts/install.sh` to install packages and set it up as a systemctl service.
3. Run `sudo raspi-config` and enable I2C.
4. Connect the GY-511 to the raspberry GPIO-pins
5. Connect your RS232 adapter and Arduino and configure them to use a fixed name in /dev: https://www.freva.com/assign-fixed-usb-port-names-to-your-raspberry-pi/
6. Edit the device paths of Serial/Controller/Device and Serial/NmeaInput/Device to correspond to the fixed names of the arduino and RS232 adapter in the config.yml file.
7. Edit the var `APPASS="<PASSWORD>"` in `/opt/vanchor/scripts/wifi.sh` to a WIFI-password of your choice.
8. Run `/opt/vanchor/scripts/wifi.sh` to setup your raspberry as an access point. The raspberry will now reboot.
9. Run `journalctl -xef`
10. Connect the ssid named `Vanchor` with the password that you choose in step 6
11. Browse to http://10.0.0.1 and try it out while checking the logs from `journalctl -xef`

## Configuring the raspberry (with existing network + SignalK/Similar)

1. Clone vanchor to /opt/vanchor
2. Run `sudo raspi-config` and enable I2C.
3. Run `/opt/vanchor/scripts/install.sh` to install packages and set it up as a systemctl service.
4. Connect the GY-511 to the raspberry GPIO-pins assign-fixed-usb-port-names-to-your-raspberry-pi/
5. Connect your Arduino and configure them to use a fixed name in /dev: https://www.freva.com/assign-fixed-usb-port-names-to-your-raspberry-pi/
6. Edit the device path of Serial/Controller/Device to correspond to the fixed names of the arduino and RS232 adapter in the config.yml file.
7. Connect the raspberry to your boats network. A static IP or resolvable hostname is recommended.
8. Configure SignalK to forward NMEA data to port 10000 of the raspberry
9. Run `journalctl -xef`
10. Browse to http://\<ip\> and try it out while checking the logs from `journalctl -xef`

## Hardware

While it's easily modifiable I used the following when it comes to hardware (NOT affiliate links):

- Raspberry Pi 4
- RS232 -> USB adapter
- 6-24V step-down module /w USB (https://www.amazon.se/dp/B09DPJXNTP)

  - Note: I use a 60Amp controller on my 40Amp engine as a safety margin.
- L298N (for stepper) (https://www.amazon.se/gp/product/B077NY9RY6)
- Stepper Motor (https://www.amazon.se/gp/product/B072LVXVKW)

- Anti-corrosion spray for electronics (for protecting the electronics)
- Flex-PVC pipe for the power cables to the trolling motor.
- Silicon for waterproofing
- Various screws/bolts. See parts list [here.](./docs/drawing.pdf).

### Gearbox

The gearbox is 3D-printed in PLA and seems to hold up. [You can find the STL's in 3d/gearbox ](./3d/gearbox).

<img src="./3d/Exploded.png" width="70%">

An exploded drawing is available [here.](./docs/drawing.pdf).

You mount an "hang-in"-style mount on the trolling motor that locks into place in the gearbox when the trolling motor is lowered.

#### Assembly:

- Assemble the parts according to the drawing and save the trolling motor holder for last.
- Disassemble the trolling motor and flip the transom mount so that the box holder can lock the gearbox into place (if possible)
- Take the gearbox and slide it over the trolling motor shaft
- Mount the trolling motor holder in the existing screw hole to mount it into place (or clean it off with IPA and use CA glue).
